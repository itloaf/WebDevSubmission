            The listed requirements for this project are as follows:
        </h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>The site must be professional in appearance. We will deduct points for clear aesthetic errors anywhere on your site that reduce readability or are distracting. These include, but are not limited to:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blue text on red background is atrocious</li>
                    <li>Animated gif backgrounds are horrific</li>
                    <li>Red text on gray background is impossible to read</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
            <li>The site must be hosted online (e.g., via GitHub pages as shown in the previous section).</li>
                <br />
            <li>The site must not have any broken content: images, links, videos, etc.</li>
                <br />
            <li>The site must include a resume portion created in html (not as a pdf). This should be a useful resume with good information organized in an easy-to-access way.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Useful information includes:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>education</li>
                            <li>work experience</li>
                            <li>skills</li>
                            <li>distinguishing awards/honors</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>You do not need to include your contact information unless you want to.</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
            <li>A "from-scratch" page, which must be created from a blank html file and include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write both html and css:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An unordered list embedded in an ordered list</li>
                    <li>At least one image (not from the bootstrap theme)</li>
                    <li>An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn't teach you this, so you would have to Google this -- good learning experience)</li>
                    <li>An on-page anchor</li>
                    <li>A custom background color or image</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
            <li>You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)</li>
                    <li>Styles that specify font color</li>
                    <li>Styles that specify font family</li>
                    <li>At least three divs that are positioned and styled using your styles</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
            <li>A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This graph can be about anything. It doesn't have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.</li>
                    <li>A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
            <li>Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.</li>
                <ul><li>Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to this page. This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without worrying someone might find this DIY page.</li></ul>

                Further Requirements for Graduate Students
                <br />
                <font size="3">NOTE: I am not a graduate student, so the following do not apply to this submission.</font>
            </div>
        </h2>

        Graduate students are required to make one additional page beyond the requirements listed above. If you are a graduate student, you must also include a link on this from-scratch page to your extra page.
        <br />
        This additional page should:
        <ol>
            <li>Be focused on their area of expertise (e.g., marketing, accounting, strategy, etc.).</li>
                <br />
            <li>Include content that highlights:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your projected career path</li>
                    <li>Your individual experience in this field to date (e.g., internship)</li>
                    <li>Your anticipated contributions to this field (i.e., how will the field/world benefit from you joining this field?)</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
                <li>This page should include relevant media such as images and videos, if appropriate.</li>
                <ul><li>Feel free to include graphs, if appropriate.</li></ul>
     </ol>
     <ul><li>Note: You can include this page as one of the bootstrap-themed pages or you can build it from scratch.</li></ul>
